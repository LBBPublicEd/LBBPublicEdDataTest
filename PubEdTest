#Use the data to find the cost of the new allotment by editing the code below. You will need to do the following:
# 1. open the sas file "lefty" as pandas dataframe
# 2. open each the "dist" csv files as a pandas dataframe
# 3. merge lefty to each dist dataframes on cntydist in the loop
# 4. read the scenario and create a new dataframe foe each year with the variables: cntydist and a new one, "lefty_allot" that gives the cost per cntydist 
#     based on the bill
#
#Scenario: You are assigned to HB68. The bill would allot money to districts for their left-handed students so the district can pay for left-
# handed equipment. The bill would take effect in fiscal year 2022. Each year, for each left handed student, a district will be given $125. 
# The bill also limits the total state cost to $100,000 every year. If giving $125 per left-handed student exceeds the limit of $100,000, each 
# district's allotment will be reduced proportionally until the amount equals $100,000. In fiscal year 2025 and every year after the district will 
# given $100 per lefty, but there will be no statewide limit.
#
#We are only given left-handed population in each district for one year. We decide to tie left-handed population growth the district's 
# enrollment growth or "enroll". So if a district grows by 5% from 2022 to 2023 then the left-handed population should grow accordingly.
